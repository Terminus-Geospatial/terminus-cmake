# terminus_test_prepare_unit
#
# Prepares for creation of unit test targets by finding all the required libraries and bringing
# additional utilities into scope.

# terminus_test_add_unit
#
# Adds a new unit test to the test suite. Tests are discovered via GTest. Each invocation of this
# function will create a new executable target that can be run using the `ctest` cmmand. It is
# assumed that the `enable_testing()` command has already been called in the root-level
# `CMakeLists.txt`
#
# Expected Positional Arguments
# -----------------------------
# - (1) SUFFIX
#       The unique suffix to add the end of the target name for this test. Tests are all prefixed
#       with `test_unit_${PROJECT_NAME}_`.
# - (2) FILE
#       The source file that contains the tests. This is the file that will be compiled into the
#       test executable. If it contains a custom `main()` function, then you must use the
#       `INCLUDES_MAIN` option.
#
# Options
# -------
# - INCLUDES_MAIN
#   If present, it is expected that the provided source file contains a user-defined `main()`
#   function, and so the GTest targets that include main will not be used.
#
# Single-valued Options
# - TARGET
#   The name of the primary target to link against. This should be a static or shared library that
#   contains the logic to test. If not provided, `PROJECT_NAME` will be used.
#
# Multi-valued Options
# --------------------
# - EXTRA_LIBS
#   Specifies a list of additional ibraries to link the test target against.
