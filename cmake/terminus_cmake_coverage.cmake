# Verifies that `gcov` is installed on the system and then proceeds to create the `coverage` target
# that, when invoked, will run all tests with `ctest` and generate code coverage reports for all
# compiled targets in the project.
#
# When the `coverage` target is run, `gcov` will collect coverage reports and place them in the
# `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/coverage` directory. Only coverage for files contained within the project
# will be included in the report.

# It is best to call this function at the end of configuring all the source targets.
